# Architecture Compliance Report

## Executive Summary

This report details the findings of an audit of the project's source code against the established architectural rules. The audit focused on file length, adherence to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), and the use of specified architectural patterns (ViewModel, Manager, Coordinator).

**Overall, the project shows a strong commitment to a clean and scalable architecture, but there are several significant violations that need to be addressed.** The core application logic (`src`) is generally well-structured, but the `scripts` and `casino-agent` directories contain several "God Classes" that violate multiple rules.

## Key Findings

*   **God Classes:** Several files in the `scripts` and `casino-agent` directories are monolithic "God Classes" that handle too many responsibilities. These files are the most significant violation of the architectural rules.
*   **File Length Violations:** Five files were identified that exceed the 500-line limit. All of these are "God Classes".
*   **Incorrect Use of ViewModels:** Several files in the `src/viewmodels` directory are not ViewModels at all, but rather collections of business logic functions.
*   **Data and Logic Mixing:** Many files, particularly data providers and services, contain hardcoded data that should be externalized to JSON files.
*   **Missing Architectural Layers:** The `managers` and `coordinators` directories are not present at the root of the `src` directory, as the architectural guidelines suggest they should be.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. File Length and "God Class" Violations

The following files were found to be in violation of the 500-line limit and the Single Responsibility Principle:

*   `scripts/advanced-seo-analyzer.js` (1300+ lines): A "God Class" for SEO analysis.
*   `casino-agent/src/CasinoAgent.ts` (1000+ lines): A "God Class" for page generation.
*   `scripts/structure-aware-page-generator.js` (700+ lines): A "God Class" for site generation.
*   `scripts/content-strategy.js` (700+ lines): A "God Class" for content strategy.
*   `scripts/geo-aware-logo-scraper.js` (500+ lines): A "God Class" for logo scraping.

**Recommendation:** Each of these files should be broken down into smaller, more focused modules. For example, `advanced-seo-analyzer.js` should be split into separate classes for `TechnicalSEOAnalyzer`, `PerformanceAnalyzer`, `ContentAnalyzer`, etc.

### 2. Architectural Pattern Violations

#### ViewModels

*   The `src/viewmodels` directory contains a mix of correctly and incorrectly implemented ViewModels.
*   Files like `HomeVM.ts`, `RegionVM.ts`, `ReviewVM.ts`, and `ToplistVM.ts` are not ViewModels. They are collections of functions that contain business logic.
    *   **Recommendation:** This logic should be moved to `Manager` classes (e.g., `CasinoManager`, `RegionManager`). The `*VM.ts` files should be deleted.
*   The `*ViewModel.ts` files are generally well-structured, but some contain business logic and hardcoded data that should be extracted.
    *   **Recommendation:** Refactor these ViewModels to delegate all business logic to `Manager` classes and all data provision to `DataProvider` classes.

#### Managers and Coordinators

*   The `managers` and `coordinators` directories are not present at the root of the `src` directory. Instead, they are scattered throughout the codebase (e.g., inside `viewmodels`).
    *   **Recommendation:** Create `src/managers` and `src/coordinators` directories and move all `Manager` and `Coordinator` classes to these locations.

### 3. Data and Logic Mixing

*   Several data providers and services contain hardcoded data.
    *   `ContentDataService.ts`: Contains a large amount of default content.
    *   `NavigationDataService.ts`: Contains hardcoded navigation links.
    *   `RegionCasinoFilterService.ts`: Contains hardcoded region data.
    *   `AffiliateDisclosureProvider.ts`, `ExpertTeamDataProvider.ts`, `SupportChannelsDataProvider.ts`: Contain hardcoded content.
    *   **Recommendation:** Externalize all hardcoded data to JSON files (e.g., `content.json`, `navigation.json`, `regions.json`) and have the providers and services load this data.

## Recommendations for Refactoring

1.  **Break up the "God Classes":** This is the highest priority. The five large files identified in the `scripts` and `casino-agent` directories should be refactored into smaller, single-responsibility modules.
2.  **Refactor the `viewmodels` directory:** Move all business logic from the `*VM.ts` files into `Manager` classes. Refactor the `*ViewModel.ts` files to remove any remaining business logic and hardcoded data.
3.  **Organize the architectural layers:** Create `src/managers` and `src/coordinators` directories and move all relevant classes into them.
4.  **Externalize all hardcoded data:** Move all hardcoded content and configuration from services and providers into JSON files.

By addressing these issues, the project will be in full compliance with the architectural rules, resulting in a more maintainable, scalable, and robust codebase.
